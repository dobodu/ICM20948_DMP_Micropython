To be completed

This library supports ICM20948 9 axis sensor with Micropython

It can be used as a direct sensor library but can also deals with DMP processor

It's in Beta stage for now and need debugging and verifications.

Many thank to SPARKFUN C library who helped me so much in understanding DMP way of working
